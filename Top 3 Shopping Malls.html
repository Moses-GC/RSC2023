        <div class="introdes">Shopping is one of Singapore's national pastimes, and we've all spent time walking from one shopping
                mall to another similar air-conditioned haven,
                sometimes to chase the best deals, and also to escape the heat. In a town where mall culture is strong,
                it can get a little hectic when it comes to
                navigating shops at different malls. These 3 malls will guarantee satisfaction and zero regrets.</div>

            <p>Located in between the Marina Reservoir and the three iconic towers of Marina Bay Sands, the Shoppes at
                Marina Bay Sands is a
                magnificent glass structure that houses an impressive collection of luxury brands under its roof. Almost
                every luxury brand you
                can think of can be found along its corridors, with the exception of Louis Vuitton which is housed in a
                crystal island on the
                Marina Reservoir facing the Shoppes. The interior is spacious and classy, with natural light shining in
                through the glass
                which adds to its elegance.</p>

            <p>The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands is also home to a host of celebrity chef restaurants such as CUT by
                Wolfgang Puck,
                DB Bistro and Oyster Bar and Adrift by David Meyers. Special features of the mall include an indoor
                canal where
                shoppers can take a sampan ride and be transported through the mall and the Rain Oculus which gathers
                and pours out
                22,000 litres of water per minute, a laudable effort in the resort's practice of sustainability. While
                you're there,
                be sure to catch Spectra, a breathtaking laser display and light show which plays twice nightly at 8pm
                and 9pm.</p>

            <p>Located opposite the shores of Sentosa Island is VivoCity, one of the largest shopping malls in
                Singapore. Its many retail stores
                and restaurants are spread out over more than 1 million square feet of lettable floor space spanning 5
                storeys. Besides a plethora
                of fast fashion brands and casual dining restaurants, it also houses a cinema, TANGS departmental store,
                local supermarket giant Fairprice's
                largest store, library@harbourfront and the monorail station which offers direct connectivity to
                Sentosa. Shoppers who are tired from shopping
                can take a break at the sky park and amphitheatre at the top floor which offers astounding views of the
                sea and Sentosa Island.</p>

            <p>Designed by Japanese architect Toyo Ito, VivoCity's architecture is distinctly different from other
